        "The Department of Computing Technologies organized the ROBOSTIM 1.0 Workshop on 9th November 2023 at the Intelligent System Design Lab TP1509. It was attended by 1st-year students from the Computing Technologies department.",
        "The workshop began with an introductory session by Dr. E. Poovammal, who explained the lab's vision and objectives. Mr. Thirumalazhagan from SiGe Tech conducted the next session, covering the components used in robotics and demonstrating the DOFBOT robotic arm.",
        "Trained students Mr. Shivam Bansal and Mr. Kavin Sundareswaran (2nd year CTECH) then led a TINKER CAD simulation session, helping students prototype their ideas virtually before implementing them physically. The event concluded with team activities where students simulated and implemented basic robotic setups."

      "The Robo Workshop 2025, held on 19th July 2025 at Tech Park 1, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, brought together 50+ students from over 5 schools for an exciting introduction to robotics and hands-on hardware development.",
      "Participants received guided training on Smorphi robotics kits—modular, open-source platforms ideal for rapid prototyping. They learned about the fundamentals of robotic systems and engaged in assembling and programming their own robots using the provided kits.",
      "The Smorphi platform enabled students to test algorithms and simulate payloads in real-time, fostering creativity and engineering thinking. This experience bridged the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, and provided a glimpse into modern prototyping practices used in industry.",
      "The workshop concluded with interactive challenges where teams presented their Smorphi builds and demonstrated various robotic tasks, encouraging teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation among young learners."
